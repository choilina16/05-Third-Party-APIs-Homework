## Third Party APIs Description 

Criteria need:
* When opening the planner, current day is displayed at the top
* When I scroll down, I'm presented with time bloacks (ex: 12PM, 1PM, 2PM...)
* When I view the time blocks for that day, each time bloack is color coded to indicate whether it's in the past, present, or future
* When I click on the time event, I can enter an event
* When I click on the save button for that timeblock, text is saved to the local storage
* When I refresh the page, events are saved and remains on page
